# Installing cutevariant

## As a pip package

If you already have python, installation will be quite easy using pip.

Just run the following command in your favorite shell:

```bash
pip install cutevariant
```

> :material-information-outline: Please note that in order to avoid any conflict between python modules, it is strongly advised that you install cutevariant in its own python virtual environment. However, due to the very few dependencies of cutevariant (only PySide2 and numpy for now), this package will have very low impact on your python environment.

## Download Windows binaries

If you run Windows and don't wish to install python along with pip, there is a binary executable for windows, published every realease.
