# Welcome to the official Cutevariant documentation !


## What is cutevariant used for?

Cutevariant is a free opensource software to help researchers and geneticians quickly and easily browse big VCF files.
You can use this software to highlight variants in any genome, even offline and with no need for a Master's degree in bioinformatics.

Cutevariant also lets you export your work in many file formats, so you can share your results with the whole community.
